# Breast Cancer Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to predict whether a breast tumor is **benign** or **malignant** based on various features. The **Breast Cancer Dataset** from sklearn is used to train a **Linear Regression** model. The model achieves an **accuracy of 95%**, making it an effective tool for breast cancer prediction.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: Scientific computing with arrays.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Data visualization for statistical graphics.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and utilities.

## Dataset

The project uses the **Breast Cancer Dataset** available in **sklearn.datasets**, which contains features related to cell nuclei characteristics like radius, texture, smoothness, etc. The target variable indicates whether the tumor is **benign** (1) or **malignant** (0).
